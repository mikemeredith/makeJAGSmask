CHANGES in 0.1.1.9001 2019-07-13

  * Function 'plotACs' gains arguments 'rad', 'link' and 'colors'.

  * Fixed bug in 'convertOutput' when input is a matrix.

  * Fixed bug in 'convertRaster', which was trimming too much.

CHANGES in 0.1.1 2019-07-02

  * Function 'convertRaster' now accepts RasterStack objects as well as RasterLayer.

  * A RasterStack object, 'patchRS', added to 'simSCR' data set.

  * Added 'trueACs' and boundary of 'Arkadia' to 'simSCR' data set.

CHANGES in 0.1.0 2019-06-28

  * Added function 'convertRaster'.

  * Replaced 'exampleData' with 'simSCR', revised most of the examples in help pages.

  * New function 'plotACs' to plot activity centres.

  * 'convertOutput' recognises 'x' and 'y' as names in input.

  * 'plot.JAGSmask' now uses 'image' instead of 'plot.default'.

  * New function 'addCore' adds a core area matrix to a 'JAGSmask' object.

  * 'pixelWidth' now included in the 'JAGSmask' output list; the attribute retained
  for the moment.

  * Added note to help page that sigma is in pixel units.

CHANGES in 0.0.6 2017-06-20

  * Fixed bug in 'plot.JAGSmask' which was not working correctly with only 1 trap
  in bad habitat.

  * Added checks to 'randomPoints' function: now warns if a fixed location is in
  bad habitat.

CHANGES in 0.0.5 2017-06-15

  * Fixed bug in 'convertMask' which was giving 'subscript out of range' errors.

CHANGES in 0.0.4 2016-08-06

  * 'convertOutput' now accepts a single array, matrix, data frame or list as input,
  instead of separate x and y objects.

  * Added convenience function 'pixelWidth'.

CHANGES in 0.0.3 2016-08-05

  * In 'JAGSmask' objects, 'extent' replaced with 'upperLimit'.

  * Added function 'randomPoints' to generate starting values.

CHANGES in 0.0.2 2016-08-04

  * Output from 'convertMask' is now an object of class 'JAGSmask' with print and
  plot methods. It is a list which now includes 'extent' and 'area'. The bounding box,
  false origin and pixel width are provided as attributes.

  * Plotting is now done by the 'plot.JAGSmask' method.

  * 'convertOutput' can now accept a list with x and y coordinates as its first
  argument; the mask argument is now called 'JAGSmask'.

CHANGES in 0.0.1 2016-08-01

  * First attempt
