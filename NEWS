TODO

  * Maybe add starting values to the output - but should be different for each chain.

CHANGES in 0.0.3 2016-08-05

  * In 'JAGSmask' objects, 'extent' replaced with 'upperLimit'.

  * Add function 'randomPoints'.

CHANGES in 0.0.2 2016-08-04

  * Output from 'convertMask' is now an object of class 'JAGSmask' with print and
  plot methods. It is a list which now includes 'extent' and 'area'. The bounding box,
  false origin and pixel width are provided as attributes.

  * Plotting is now done by the 'plot.JAGSmask' method.

  * 'convertOutput' can now accept a list with x and y coordinates as its first
  argument; the mask argument is now called 'JAGSmask'.
