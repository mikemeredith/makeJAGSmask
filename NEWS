  * Fixed bug in 'convertMask' which was giving 'subscript out of range' errors.

CHANGES in 0.0.4 2016-08-06

  * 'convertOutput' now accepts a single array, matrix, data frame or list as input,
  instead of separate x and y objects.

  * Added convenience function 'pixelWidth'.

CHANGES in 0.0.3 2016-08-05

  * In 'JAGSmask' objects, 'extent' replaced with 'upperLimit'.

  * Added function 'randomPoints' to generate starting values.

CHANGES in 0.0.2 2016-08-04

  * Output from 'convertMask' is now an object of class 'JAGSmask' with print and
  plot methods. It is a list which now includes 'extent' and 'area'. The bounding box,
  false origin and pixel width are provided as attributes.

  * Plotting is now done by the 'plot.JAGSmask' method.

  * 'convertOutput' can now accept a list with x and y coordinates as its first
  argument; the mask argument is now called 'JAGSmask'.
